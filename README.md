Blurz is a Rainmeter skin suite that is inspired by [Eldog02's Proximity skin](https://eldogrm.github.io/skins/proximity.html).

## Installation

This skin is still in development so there is no Rainmeter Skin Package *yet*.

Please refer [Rainmeter's documentation](https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/installing-skins/) for instructions about manual installation by downloading the files as a ZIP.

## Usage
Read the [wiki](https://github.com/fkoulen/Blurz/wiki) to find information about how to use and customize the skins!
